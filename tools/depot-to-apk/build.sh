      which is the whole volume once READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE is granted. The two

      Requested at runtime, and refusing costs nothing. The app's own external

      Steam's CDN serves depot chunks over plain HTTP, and its own clients
      download them that way: each chunk is encrypted with the depot key and
      checksummed before anything is written, so the transport adds nothing
      the format does not already provide.

      This is deliberately the blunt attribute rather than a network security
      config naming Valve's hosts. Declaring any <domain-config> switches the
      platform to a domain-aware TrustManager, and any TLS stack that calls
      the two-argument checkServerTrusted then fails with "Domain specific
      configurations require that hostname aware checkServerTrusted is used".
      That is what the Steam login connection does, so the scoped version
      fixed the chunks and broke the sign-in.

      Nothing is downgraded by this: it permits cleartext where a URL asks for
      it, and every other connection here (the Steam login, the fetches from
      Unity) asks for https and stays encrypted.

      hasFragileUserData puts a "Keep app data?" checkbox on the uninstall
      dialog (Android 10+). Without it an uninstall silently takes the depot
      with it, and that is a multi-gigabyte download and a ~27 minute rebuild
      to get back, along with any save that was not synced to Steam Cloud.
      The data this app accumulates is far more expensive than the app.

          A non-resizeable activity on a large screen (a foldable's inner
          display, a tablet) is put into size compatibility mode: the system
          gives it a phone-shaped window in the middle of the panel and fills
          the rest with black. That is the "black bars top and bottom" report
          from a Galaxy Z Fold 6, and it happens before a single line of the
          game runs.

          The usual reason to opt out is that a resizeable activity can be put
          into split screen and resized under you. Both are handled: every
          config that can change is in configChanges above, so the activity is
          never recreated (a recreation here would restart the game), and
          ResolutionGuard follows the window's shape whatever it becomes.

          screenOrientation stays sensorLandscape. It is honoured in full
          screen and ignored in split screen, which is the right behaviour in
          both: the game is landscape, and a window the user has shaped by
