# Build libil2cpp.so ON AN ANDROID DEVICE from IL2CPP-generated C++.
#
# Proves the final link in the on-device build chain: a phone compiling and
# linking the game's native code itself, with no PC involved. Uses Termux's
# aarch64-hosted clang (Android has no system compiler) plus the NDK sysroot
# for the bionic headers and the static libc++ that Unity itself links against.
#
# Layout expected under $ROOT:
#   usr/       Termux toolchain (clang, lld, its own libs)
#   sysroot/   NDK sysroot (bionic headers + libc++_static.a)
#   cpp/       IL2CPP-generated .cpp/.c translation units
#   libil2cpp/ + external/   IL2CPP runtime sources and headers
#   baselib.a  Unity's prebuilt arm64 static library
#
# Any of those may be a symlink, and each can instead be pointed somewhere else
# entirely with the matching variable below. When the app drives this build the
# pieces are already on the device in three different places -- the toolchain on
# internal storage because that is the only kind Android will exec from, the
# generated C++ and the Unity sources on external storage because that is where
# there is room -- and naming them is cheaper than copying several gigabytes to
# satisfy a layout.
#
# It used to LINK them into one directory instead, which is nicer to poke at by
# hand and is not portable: $ROOT is on external storage, that is FUSE-backed,
# and FUSE returns EPERM for symlink() on most Android builds. It happens to be
# permitted on some vendor ROMs, which is why this survived until a Retroid
# Pocket Flip 2 met it. Paths cost nothing and work everywhere.
#
# Hence find -L throughout: with a symlinked layout, a find rooted at a linked
# directory returns the link and nothing under it, and the build silently
# compiles nothing.

# Every one of the 946 generated C++ units opens with #include "pch-cpp.hpp",
# and every one of the 196 generated C units with "pch-c.h". Those headers pull
# in the il2cpp internals plus <limits>, <cmath> and <cstring> -- so without a
# precompiled header that work is done from source 1142 times over. Unity ships
# the headers precisely so it need not be.
#
# The PCH must be built with the SAME flags as the units that use it; clang
# refuses one compiled with different ones, which is why this shares $CXXFLAGS
# $DEF $INC $TGT rather than naming them again. libil2cpp's own runtime sources
# do not include either header, so phase C is compiled without one.
#
# A failure here is not fatal. The PCH is an optimisation, and a build that is
# slower is better than a build that does not happen.
# What a precompiled header was built against.
#
# Clang validates a PCH against the modification time of every header it
# pulled in, and refuses it when any differs -- "has been modified since the
# precompiled header was built". On the PC that happened without anything
# changing: the Docker image is rebuilt on every run, a rebuilt layer
# re-extracts the NDK with fresh mtimes, and the PCH in the build volume was
# from the previous image. Every translation unit then failed, and the
# twenty-minute build with it.
#
# So the PCH carries a stamp of what it was built with -- the compiler, the
# sysroot, and the mtime and size of one header from each tree it includes --
# and is rebuilt when that stamp changes. The mtime-based test on the pch
# header alone missed this because the header that moved was the sysroot's.
# It is a cheap check (three stats) against an expensive failure.
#
# stat -c is toybox and coreutils; a system without it gets an empty stamp,
# which rebuilds the PCH every run: ten seconds, and always correct.

echo "### PHASE D: linking libil2cpp.so"
# baselib.a is Unity's PREBUILT arm64-android static library (shipped in the
# Editor's AndroidPlayer StaticLibs). It is not compilable from the sources in
# external/baselib, and without it the .so fails at dlopen on
# Baselib_Timer_TickToNanosecondsConversionFactor.
#
# -nostdlib++ with the NDK's static libc++: Unity's libil2cpp.so has no
# libc++_shared dependency, and the app process will not have Termux's libs.
#
# -soname matters once the library is loaded from app storage rather than out
# of the APK. The engine asks for it by name -- dlopen("libil2cpp.so") -- and
# bionic satisfies that from an already-loaded library by matching its soname.
# Preloading an absolute path only works if the library actually carries the
# name the engine will ask for; without DT_SONAME the match depends on how the
# loader derives a name from the path, which is not worth relying on.
# The link's own output goes to err.log and its STATUS is checked.
#
# This used to end in `2>&1 | head -10`, which is two problems in one. A pipe
# makes $? the status of the LAST command, so the shell saw head's success and
# never the linker's failure; and head closing the pipe after ten lines sends
# the linker SIGPIPE, so a link that had more than ten warnings to give was
# killed by the thing reading its warnings.
#
# Neither was visible, because the check below asked whether the output FILE
# existed -- and lld creates and sizes that file early, so it exists no matter
# how the link ends. The result was a build that reported success and left
# behind a libil2cpp.so that was 151 KB short of the real one and crashed in
# the dynamic linker, running an .init_array entry, before a line of game code:
#
#   #00 pc 00000000030f3740  <unknown>
#   #01 linker64 (__dl__ZN6soinfo17call_constructorsEv+752)
#
# So: no pipe, the status is kept, and a failed link takes its output with it
# rather than leaving a corpse for the installer to pick up and the engine to
# dlopen twenty minutes later.
#
# max-page-size is 16 KB because Android 15 allows devices whose pages are,
# and a library aligned for 4 KB cannot be mapped on one. lld defaults to 4 KB
# for Android, so it has to be asked. Nothing is lost on a 4 KB device -- the
# alignment is padding between segments, which such a kernel maps happily, and
# every other .so in the APK is already built this way.
# Only the compile flags are covered by the signature above ($TGT, $DEF, $INC,
# $CXXFLAGS), so changing anything on this line rebuilds nothing: obj/ survives
# and the relink takes about eight seconds. That is deliberate and worth
# knowing when testing a link flag -- it is a cheap experiment, not a
# twenty-minute one.
#
# --no-undefined is what turns a short link into a failure here rather than a
# crash twenty minutes later on someone else's device. -shared allows undefined
# symbols by default, so a generated tree that is missing translation units --
# a conversion killed part-way, a phase that compiled nothing -- still links,
# into an engine that is a few megabytes short and dies in the dynamic linker
# at launch. The engine reports that as
#
#   dlopen failed: library "libil2cpp.so" not found
#
# which names neither the file it did find nor the symbol it could not
# resolve, because it is the error from the fallback lookup by soname and not
# from the load that actually failed. Two separate incidents have now been
# spent working back from that sentence.
#
# It is compatible with --allow-shlib-undefined below: that one is about
# unresolved references inside the shared libraries being linked AGAINST, this
# one is about symbols nothing on the link line defines at all.
