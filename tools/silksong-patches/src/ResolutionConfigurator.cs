// ResolutionConfigurator — the frame cap, and a sensible starting resolution.
//
// ── the resolution ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This used to be a launcher setting: pick 720p/900p/1080p/native in Settings,
// and every boot would force it with Screen.SetResolution. That is gone, and
// the reason it could go is worth writing down, because it was not obvious.
//
// Unity persists the resolution ON ANDROID. After a Screen.SetResolution the
// player prefs carry
//
//     Screenmanager Resolution Width  = 1280
//     Screenmanager Resolution Height = 720
//     Screenmanager Fullscreen mode   = 1
//
// and the engine restores them on the next launch. So there is nothing to
// re-apply: forcing it every boot was not making it stick, it was overwriting
// whatever the player had chosen since.
//
// What is left is a default. 720p, applied exactly once, on a device that has
// never run this before -- roughly half the pixels of a 1080p panel, which is
// most of a battery saving on art that tolerates the downscale. After that the
// game owns it, including through its own resolution menu, and nothing here
// touches it again.
//
// Nothing is clamped any more either. The old code refused to set anything at
// or above the panel's short dimension, which meant the highest modes were
// unreachable by design; the panel's own modes are exactly what the game's
// menu offers, and they should work.
//
// ── the shape ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every size here is derived from the shape of the WINDOW, asked of Android,
// and never from Screen.resolutions. That array describes the DISPLAY, and the
// two are not the same rectangle: a foldable's inner screen, a large-screen
// device that letterboxes us, split-screen, all give a window smaller and a
// different shape from the panel behind it.
//
// Rendering at a shape the window does not have is the bug this replaces --
// black bars all the way round on a 4:3 handheld and on a Galaxy Fold, on top
// of whatever the game does. Matching the window means the engine scales our
// frame to it and nothing is added.
//
// What is NOT ours to fix is the game's own limit. ForceCameraAspect clamps the
// viewport it renders into to 1.6 : 1 at the narrow end
//
//     AutoScaleViewportShared:
//         MinMaxFloat(1.6f, 2.3916667f).GetClampedBetween(w / (float)h)
//
// and letterboxes whatever is left, so a 4:3 screen keeps ~8% bars and a Fold's
// ~1.16:1 inner screen keeps ~14%, exactly as they would on a PC monitor of the
// same shape. That is Team Cherry's framing decision, it is the same on every
// platform, and the game already ships the control that overrides it: the
// Overscan slider in its own video options grows the viewport past the screen
// edges, trading the bars for cropped sides.

    /**
     * The frame cap, held rather than set, and vsync held off with it.
     *
     * The game stores its cap in PlayerPrefs as VidTFR and offers four values:
     * -1 ("off"), 30, 60 and 120, plus the panel's own rate when that exceeds
     * 120. -1 means "uncapped" on a desktop, but Unity reads a negative target
     * as its mobile default of 30, so the option meant to remove the limit is
     * the one that imposes the worst one.
     *
     * The other half is VSync, and it is the larger one. The game's VSync
     * option does not merely enable vsync -- MenuSetting.UpdateSetting, case
     * VSync, does this when it is switched on:
     *
     *     Platform.Current.VSyncCount = 1;
     *     Application.targetFrameRate = -1;
     *     UIManager.instance.DisableFrameCapSetting();
     *
     * So turning vsync on sets the same -1 sentinel, and disables the frame cap
     * control so it cannot be set back. On Android that is a request for 30 fps
     * whatever the cap says -- and vsync is ON by default, both in
     * GameSettings (LoadInt("VidVSync", ref vSync, 1)) and in the project's own
     * QualitySettings.asset (vSyncCount: 1).
     *
     * There is no vsync-on path that reaches 120 here, because Unity ignores
     * targetFrameRate entirely while vSyncCount is non-zero and the game only
     * ever pairs vsync with -1. Holding vsync off and driving the rate from
     * targetFrameRate is the only arrangement in which the cap means anything,
     * which is why this does not try to preserve a vsync choice.
     *
     * THREE approaches failed before this one. Setting targetFrameRate once at
     * startup loses, because the game re-applies its own settings from menu
     * code. Writing VidTFR instead loses too: measured on the device, the patch
     * logged "frame cap -1 -> 120" every launch and the prefs file still read
     * -1 afterwards, because the game writes its in-memory value back after
     * ours. So both values are GUARDED instead -- see FrameCapHolder, which
     * needs no stored state and no timer to do it. The prefs are still written,
     * because it costs nothing and makes the menu agree when it is read fresh.
     *
     * A deliberate 30 or 60 is still respected -- that is a real choice about
     * battery. The one migration exception is the port's own old automatic
     * Vulkan cap of 30: the GLES profile promotes that to its automatic 60
     * once, then records which value is automatic so a later manual 30 stays.

/**
 * Puts the resolutions the player actually wants into the game's own menu.
 *
 * Silksong builds its resolution list from Screen.resolutions
 * (MenuResolutionSetting.RefreshAvailableResolutions). On Android that array
 * describes the panel as it is mounted rather than as it is held -- one entry,
 * 1080x1920, portrait -- so the menu offers a single unusable option. The one
 * thing that saves it is a fallback in RefreshCurrentIndex: a current
 * resolution missing from the list gets prepended. That is why the menu showed
 * exactly two entries, whichever resolution happened to be running plus the
 * portrait one, and why choosing 1080p made 720p disappear.
 *
 * So the list is replaced with the sizes this WINDOW can sensibly render: the
 * window's own size, then a ladder of smaller ones, every entry holding the
 * window's exact shape. Building them from the window rather than from
 * Screen.resolutions is what keeps a 4:3 handheld and a foldable from being
 * offered 16:9 rows that can only be displayed with bars around them.
 * Everything downstream is the game's own code and needs no help --
 * PushUpdateOptionList formats the labels, ApplySettings indexes the same array
 * we wrote, and Unity persists the result.
 *
 * The array is private, so it is set by reflection. The alternative was to
 * rewrite the menu, and this is the smaller lie: one field, restored to the
 * shape the game already expects, with every method that reads it left alone.
 * It is re-applied whenever the pane is opened, because RefreshControls runs on
 * enable and overwrites it -- and it fails silently, leaving the game's own
 * behaviour, if the field ever stops being there.
 *
 * Entries carry the CURRENT refresh rate, so the running resolution matches one
 * of them exactly (Resolution.Equals compares the rate too). Without that,
 * RefreshCurrentIndex would decide the current mode is missing and prepend a
 * near-duplicate of a row already on screen.

/**
 * Keeps the render target the same shape as the window.
 *
 * Two things go wrong without this, and they have the same cause.
 *
 * The first is a render target that never matched the window to begin with.
 * Everything used to be derived from Screen.resolutions -- the DISPLAY's modes,
 * which on a foldable, a large screen that letterboxes us, or a 4:3 handheld
 * are a different shape from the window we are actually given. A 16:9 frame in
 * a 4:3 window is displayed with bars added around it, and those bars are on
 * top of the ones the game draws itself.
 *
 * The second is rotation, and it is the same mismatch arriving later. Rotating
 * to portrait and back left the game squashed and never recovered, because the
 * old guard did one thing -- transpose a portrait Screen into a landscape one
 * -- and then remembered the size it had CORRECTED. Screen.width and
 * Screen.height report that correction back, so the test that decided whether
 * to act was reading its own output: after one transpose the guard saw
 * landscape, returned early forever, and the window underneath could change
 * shape as often as it liked without anything noticing.
 *
 * So the question asked here is about the WINDOW, which is the one thing our
 * own corrections cannot change. Every window that is a different shape from
 * the frame we are rendering gets exactly one correction, and a window that
 * changes again -- rotated back, unfolded, resized -- is a different window and
 * gets its own. That is what makes it recover.
 *
 * The short side is left alone: how many pixels to render is the player's
 * choice, and only the shape is ours to fix. It is capped at the window's own,
 * because rendering more pixels than are displayed costs battery and buys
 * nothing.

/**
 * Keeps vsync off and the frame cap off the broken sentinel.
 *
 * Neither value can be set once and left. The game re-applies both from menu
 * code (MenuSetting.UpdateSetting), from Platform.SetTargetFrameRate, and from
 * Platform.RestoreFrameRate after a video; QualitySettings.SetQualityLevel also
 * resets vSyncCount to the project default, which is 1. None of those is
 * reachable from here -- the patches are an additional assembly compiled
 * against the game, not a rewrite of it -- so there is nothing to subscribe to
 * and the values have to be guarded rather than assigned.
 *
 * The guard is two engine property reads per frame and nothing else. There is
 * deliberately no timer and no PlayerPrefs lookup: an earlier version polled
 * the pref every three seconds, which was both more expensive per check and
 * wrong, because it read the stored cap to decide whether to act and our own
 * startup code had just written a positive value into it -- so it returned
 * early forever and never corrected anything.
 *
 * The test that works needs no stored state at all. The game applies the
 * player's chosen cap by assigning Application.targetFrameRate directly, so a
 * positive value already IS their choice, whatever it is, and is left alone. A
 * value at or below zero can only be the "off" sentinel, which Unity reads on
 * Android as 30. Replacing just that is the ordinary job, and it happens within
 * a frame rather than within three seconds. LowMemoryProfile also supplies a
 * positive maximum: on a 3 GB device the game's stored 120 fps is held at 30.
