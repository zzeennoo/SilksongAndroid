// ShaderWarmup — eliminates the 0.5-1 s per-shader-on-first-use
// hitches that show up the first time a scene draws something with
// a new shader. On Adreno's Vulkan driver every shader pipeline
// gets compiled lazily on first draw: when a scene transition
// loads a new bundle with previously-unused shaders, the first
// frame that touches them blocks while the driver builds the
// pipeline state object (PSO), and the player sees a stutter
// (sometimes a long enough one for the framerate counter to dip
// into the teens).
//
// `Shader.WarmupAllShaders()` walks every Shader Unity currently
// has loaded and forces the driver to build PSOs for them up
// front. Doing it ONCE after each scene load front-loads the cost
// into the load transition — where a brief pause is already
// expected — and trades for smooth gameplay afterwards.
//
// That trade is wrong on a 3 GB device. The driver allocations made while
// warming every loaded shader are not all charged to the app's PSS, and the
// AYANEO's low-memory killer has been observed killing even the foreground
// game while this work makes the whole device unresponsive. LowMemoryProfile
// therefore leaves compilation lazy on those devices.
//
// We don't try to be clever about deduplication: subsequent
// WarmupAllShaders calls on already-compiled shaders are cheap
// (the Adreno driver checks its PSO cache and returns instantly).
// The expensive work only happens when a shader is genuinely new.
//
// Defers one frame via a coroutine so the warmup runs AFTER scene
// rendering has actually wired up — calling it inside the
// sceneLoaded callback can race with addressables that finish
// loading mid-frame and miss some shaders.
