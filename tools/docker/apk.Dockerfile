# Silksong Android port — APK build environment, with no Unity in it.
#
# The APK contains no game content and nothing Unity-made: it fetches Unity's
# toolchain, downloads the user's own Steam depot and builds the game on the
# device. So the only Unity artefact this image's build needs is the Android
# *player module*, and that is not installed here — tools/ondevice-il2cpp/
# fetch-unity.sh pulls it at run time from Unity's CDN into the bind-mounted
# checkout, which is the same download, from the same URL and digest, that the
# app makes on the phone. Nothing Unity-licensed is baked into this image.
#
# That module also supplies Gradle 8.11, so Gradle is not installed here
# either. What is left is genuinely generic:
#
#   JDK 17     — javac/jar for the APK shell, and the JVM Gradle and d8 run on.
#                Pinned, not discovered: d8 rejects class files newer than it
#                understands, and a JDK 25 on PATH emits major version 69,
#                which fails the dex step with no obvious connection to the JDK.
#   Android SDK— platform android.jar and build-tools (d8/aapt2/zipalign/
#                apksigner). The optional `pc` target adds the pinned NDK to
#                cross-compile libil2cpp.so for arm64.
#   .NET 8 SDK — tools/bundle-surgery, which Gradle stages into the APK and
#                will not build without.
#   bsdtar     — the Android module arrives as a macOS .pkg, which is a xar
#                archive wrapping a gzipped cpio. libarchive reads both.
#
# amd64: Google ships no Linux arm64 build-tools, so aapt2 and zipalign are
# x86-64 ELF regardless of host. On Apple Silicon this runs under emulation.
