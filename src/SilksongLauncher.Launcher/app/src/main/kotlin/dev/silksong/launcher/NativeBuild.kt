// NativeBuild — compiling libil2cpp.so on the phone.
//
// The last step of the chain: 1500-odd translation units of generated C++ and
// IL2CPP runtime source, compiled and linked into the library the engine
// dlopens. About seventeen minutes cold on eight cores.
//
// The compile itself is tools/ondevice-il2cpp/build-il2cpp.sh, run rather than
// reimplemented. Its flags were recovered from Unity's own Bee build graph and
// are not guessable -- BASELIB_INLINE_NAMESPACE, the amalgamated bdwgc,
// Z_PREFIX on zlib, brotli needing libil2cpp on its include path -- and every
// one of them fails in a way that points somewhere else. Having two copies of
// that knowledge, one in shell for a terminal and one in Kotlin for the app,
// is how they drift; the script is staged into assets from the same file the
// terminal runs, and this class supplies it with a directory.
//
// That directory is the only real work here. The pieces are already on the
// device in three places, for reasons that are not negotiable: the toolchain
// on internal storage, because that is the only kind Android will exec from;
// the generated C++ and Unity's sources on external, because a build needs
// several gigabytes and internal storage is the scarce kind. Rather than copy
// any of it, they are linked into one root -- which is why the script uses
// find -L.

     * refuses with "not accessible for the namespace (default)" -- external
     * storage is not on any permitted path list, whatever the file's mode
     * says. So the finished library is copied onto internal storage, which is
     * where GameActivity's addNativeLibraryPath points the engine.
     *
     * Written to a temporary name and renamed, because this is 293 MB onto a
     * phone: an interrupted copy that kept the final name would be a
     * truncated ELF that the engine would try to load.
     *
     * Whether the copy can be skipped is decided by a stamp beside the
     * destination rather than by comparing the two files. It used to be a
     * size comparison alone, and that is not enough: two builds of this game
     * came to exactly 315563224 bytes, so a rebuilt engine was silently not
     * installed and the game went on running the previous one. That presents
     * as the change you just made not working, which is an expensive way to
     * spend an evening.
     *
     * A stamp rather than the destination's own modification time, because
     * copying that across does not survive the filesystem: setLastModified
     * lands on a second boundary here while the source carries nanoseconds,
     * so the two never compare equal. A stamp is exact, and a missing or
     * unreadable one means "install", which costs a copy and never costs
     * correctness.
     *
     * In practice the skip rarely fires: the link step rewrites the library
     * on every build, so its modification time moves even when the bytes come
     * out identical, and the copy happens. That is the intended trade. A few
     * seconds against a build measured in minutes is not worth the risk of
     * being clever about what "the same file" means.
