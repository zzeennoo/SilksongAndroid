/**
 * Turns Unity's Java classes into dex, on the device, and makes them loadable.
 *
 * The APK links against com.unity3d.player.* but contains none of it: the
 * shipped dex defines zero Unity classes and only references the dozen methods
 * [dev.silksong.shell.PlayerActivity] calls. Unity's classes.jar arrives with
 * the Android player module the app downloads, which is the user's own
 * download from Unity's CDN -- so the classes exist here, as Java bytecode,
 * and ART cannot load Java bytecode.
 *
 * So they are dexed here. The dexer is d8, shipped in the APK already dexed
 * (Google's tool, Apache-2.0). ART runs dex, so d8-as-dex runs on the phone
 * with no JVM involved; it converts classes.jar in about two seconds.
 *
 * The result is injected into the app's own class loader at process start, so
 * that when the framework instantiates GameActivity its superclass and the
 * player type resolve normally. Injecting into a *child* loader would not
 * work: the activity is loaded by the app loader, which cannot see a child.
