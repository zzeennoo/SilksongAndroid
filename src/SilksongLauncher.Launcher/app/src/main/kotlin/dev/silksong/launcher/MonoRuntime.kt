// MonoRuntime — the .NET the launcher runs its tools on.
//
// Three programs here are .NET applications: il2cpp.dll, Roslyn's csc.dll,
// and the bundle surgery tool. This is what runs them.
//
// It replaces DotnetFetcher, which built a runtime on the device at first
// launch out of Microsoft's linux-arm64 tarball and five packages from
// Debian's pool -- glibc, libstdc++, libssl and friends -- and invoked the
// whole thing through glibc's loader because Android has no
// /lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1 to name as an interpreter. That worked, then
// stopped: Android builds each app's seccomp filter from the syscalls bionic
// itself makes and answers everything else with SIGSYS rather than ENOSYS,
// and glibc 2.35 registers restartable sequences during startup. There is no
// fallback from a trap, so the process died before printing a word, and the
// only evidence was exit 159. A newer glibc will not fix it and an older one
// only postpones it: the filter is derived from bionic, so a foreign C
// library is always one syscall away from the same end.
//
// The runtime that has no such problem is the one Microsoft builds for
// Android: .NET's Mono flavour for android-arm64, linked against bionic,
// the same runtime MAUI ships. It is fetched at build time and shipped
// inside the APK, so there is nothing to download, nothing to verify at run
// time, and setup no longer needs the network at all.
//
// Two pieces, in the two places Android allows them:
//
//   lib/arm64-v8a/ holds libmonosgen-2.0.so, its components, and monohost --
//   an ordinary arm64 executable that the installer extracts to a directory
//   it will execute from. Nothing here depends on the app targeting API 28;
//   that requirement belongs to the fetched clang, which is written into the
//   data directory and governed by the SELinux domain targetSdk selects.
//
//   assets/mono-bcl holds the class library, which is data. Assets are not
//   executable and do not need to be -- the assemblies are read and JIT'd,
//   never exec'd -- but they also cannot be opened as files while they are
//   inside the APK, so they are unpacked once into filesDir.

     * Starts the run in a builder process, which is the part that can be
     * refused.
     *
     * bindService with BIND_AUTO_CREATE is what creates that process.
     * Deliberately not startService, which an app in the background may not
     * call from API 26 onwards and a build outlives the user's attention; and
     * deliberately not a ContentProvider any more, which had the same reach
     * and no way back from a refusal. See MonoService for both.
     *
     * Three things can go wrong, and all three are survivable here. bindService
     * can return false, which is the activity manager saying it will not even
     * try. The binding can be accepted and never connect, which is the process
     * failing to come up. And the process can come up and go away between
     * connecting and being handed the run. Each is retried rather than ending
     * the build: one lost start is not a reason to throw away an hour of
     * conversion.
     *
     * Every attempt takes the other process, because much the likeliest reason
     * a start is refused is the previous run's process. A run ends by killing
     * itself, and the activity manager will not start a second process with
     * the same name until that death has been reaped -- it holds the new start
     * until it is, and cancels it outright after ten seconds. Alternating
     * means an attempt never queues behind the funeral the last one tripped
     * over. See issue #4, where a device that was slow to reap refused every
     * run from the third onwards and stayed that way across a restart of the
     * app, because the state that refuses lives in system_server.
     *
     * The binding is returned rather than dropped here, and the caller holds
     * it until the run is over. Releasing it at once looks right -- the
     * message is one way, so the run is already going -- and it is what cost a
     * user their conversion: a process nothing is bound to is a cached
     * process, the cheapest thing on the device to reclaim, and this one
     * spends half an hour holding several gigabytes. A bound service's process
     * is raised towards the processes bound to it, so an open binding from the
     * foreground :launcher is the difference between il2cpp being the first
     * thing killed under pressure and it being roughly as safe as the screen
     * the user is watching. See issue #6, where a conversion was taken at
     * 583s.
