// PlayerImage — turning the depot's serialized data into an Android player image.
//
// The depot is a Linux build. Its serialized files carry a platform stamp the
// Android engine refuses ("File's Build target is: 24"), its shaders hold GLSL
// slices Android cannot load, and its version string is an internal branch
// build. This is the step that fixes all of that, and then assembles the
// result together with what the IL2CPP conversion produced into the Data
// folder the player expects.
//
// The Kotlin counterpart of step 4 of tools/depot-to-apk/build.sh. The asset
// surgery is done by the same bundle-surgery build a PC uses, carried in the
// APK and run under the .NET that MonoRuntime ships -- so its output here
// is byte-identical to a desktop run. The two edits that are plain byte pokes
// are done directly rather than shelling out for them.
//
// Two things in here are easy to get wrong and silent when they are:
//
//   "unity default resources" is an ENGINE built-in, shipped per platform, so
//   it must come from the Android player and not from the depot. The depot's
//   is the Linux one and the engine rejects it with "File's Build target is:
//   5". unity_builtin_extra beside it is the opposite -- that one is the
//   GAME's and must come from the depot.
//
//   unity_app_guid keys il2cpp's cache of what it extracts out of the package.
//   It is re-extracted only when the GUID stops matching what was cached, so a
//   GUID that is merely stable means every later build runs new generated code
//   against the first build's metadata. Nothing warns; the type indices stop
//   lining up and the first type whose parent resolves to itself sends
//   FromTypeDefinition into unbounded recursion. Hashing the metadata makes it
//   change exactly when the thing being cached changes.
