// Il2cppConverter — turning the game's IL into C++, on the device.
//
// This is the step everything else was assumed to need a PC for. Unity ships
// il2cpp as a self-contained .NET application with a Linux-x64 apphost, but
// the apphost is only a launcher: il2cpp.dll beside it is portable IL. Strip
// the bundled runtime and the deps.json, and it becomes an ordinary
// framework-dependent app that any .NET can run -- including the one
// MonoRuntime ships.
//
// This once ran on a PC, as a shell script and as steps 1 and 2 of
// tools/depot-to-apk/build.sh; both are retired. A desktop run of the same
// inputs produces byte-identical output: all generated sources and
// global-metadata.dat match by SHA-256.
//
// The assembly set is the part that is easy to get wrong, and it fails
// obscurely when it is. The depot's Managed/ folder cannot be handed to
// il2cpp wholesale -- it holds the *Mono* flavour of the class library, and
// IL2CPP wants the unityaot profile. Feeding it the Mono set does not produce
// a message about profiles; it dies deep inside the converter while building
// shared enum types, saying "System.Byte, ". The composition Unity itself uses
// for a build is:
//
//   class library   Unity's unityaot-linux profile
//   UnityEngine     the *Android* player's Managed folder, not the depot's
//                   Linux one
//   game code       the depot, and only what the two above do not provide
