// SetupActivity — the first screen, and the app's entry point.
//
// The APK ships neither the game nor the engine. Unity's redistributables are
// fetched from Unity, and the game itself is built on the device out of the
// user's own Steam depot. On a fresh install almost nothing the player needs
// is present yet.
//
// There is exactly one question worth asking: where is your copy of the game?
// Either it is already on this device, or it is in a Steam library that has to
// be signed into. Everything after that answer is machinery -- fetching a
// compiler, a .NET runtime, Unity's toolchain, converting, compiling, packing
// -- and none of it is a decision anybody can usefully make.
//
// An earlier version of this screen listed seven requirements with three
// buttons and left the user to work out which to press in what order. It was
// showing them the shape of the pipeline instead of the shape of the task.
//
// So there are three screens, in order:
//
//   1. Where is your copy of the game?
//   2. What is about to happen, and roughly how long it will take. Answering
//      the first question does not start half an hour of work on its own --
//      signing in is not consent to begin, and a screen that starts working
//      the moment a login returns gives nobody the chance to plug in first.
//   3. Progress, as three numbered steps rather than eleven internal stages.
//      The stages are real but they are not the user's model of the job; the
//      steps are "get the game", "get the tools", "build it".
//
// Nothing here is a layout resource: this screen is a few rows of text and two
// buttons, and building it in code keeps the first screen the app opens
// independent of resource merging.
