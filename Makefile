# player module is Unity's redistributable. Those go under a cache root; the
# finished APK, which contains neither, lands in build/.
#
# `cd ~ && pwd` rather than $(HOME): under Git Bash make, $(HOME) arrives as a
# Windows path whose backslashes are already eaten -- C:Usersjakobhansen --
# which is a valid-looking relative path that silently writes to the wrong

# ─── the container ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Same build, on Linux, with nothing installed on the host but Docker. No
# Unity: the Android player module is fetched at run time into build/, exactly
# as the phone fetches it. The container has no USB, so it builds the APK and
# `make install` puts it on the device.

# The incremental loop. `run --rm` discards the Gradle daemon, its
# configuration cache and Kotlin's incremental state every time; a container
# that outlives the build keeps them.

# The game is built ON THE PHONE. This drops what it produced so the app will

surgery: ## Build bundle-surgery (Gradle stages it into the APK)

surgery-test: ## Run bundle-surgery's regression tests (texture formats, DXT, report)

weaver: ## Build mod-weaver (Gradle stages it into the APK)
	dotnet build -c Release tools/mod-weaver/ModWeaver.csproj

# The one thing the APK build still needs from Unity: the Android player
# module, which carries the player classes compiled into the dex,
# UnityPlayerActivity's source, Gradle, and libunity/libmain. This is the same
# module the app downloads on the device, from the same URL and digest, so a
# machine with no Unity install can build the APK. ~670 MB, fetched once.
player: ## Fetch Unity's Android player module (instead of installing Unity)
	WHAT=android ROOT="$(PLAYER_ROOT)" bash tools/ondevice-il2cpp/fetch-unity.sh

# The compile check that matters.
#
# The patches ship as SOURCE and are compiled on the device against YOUR depot,
# so this runs the same compile here, with the same split of Unity's player
# assemblies for the engine and the depot's own for the game. It catches the
# mistakes that actually happen: a renamed field, an enum value that does not
# exist, a missing assembly reference. Ten seconds here against seven minutes
# on the phone.
#
# There used to be a second target that built the patches against stock Unity
# alone, for a machine with no game. It was deleted rather than fixed: every
# patch is guarded by `#if UNITY_ANDROID`, so it compiled 2 of 31 files and
# proved nothing about the rest, and the DLL it produced went unused once the
# device started compiling the sources itself.
check: ## Compile-check the patch sources against your depot (fast, thorough)

# The same question, asked about somebody else's mod.
#
# A plugin DLL references BepInEx and 0Harmony by name, and here those are our
# shims. This compiles them against your depot and runs the real weaver over
# the plugin, so "will this mod work" is answered in seconds rather than by a
# twenty-minute build on the phone that fails at the end.
