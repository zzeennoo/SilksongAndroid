# Notices

This project is MIT-licensed (see `LICENSE`). The APK it produces also
redistributes third-party components, listed below with their licences.

## What the APK does not contain

Stated first because it is the point of the whole design:

* **No Unity engine code.** The APK links against `com.unity3d.player.*` without
  containing it — Unity's `classes.jar` is a compile-time `--lib` only, and the
  classes it references are dexed on the device and injected into the app's
  class loader at process start. `apkanalyzer dex packages --defined-only`
  reports **zero** classes defined in the `com.unity3d` package.
* **No game code, art or audio.** Silksong is © Team Cherry. Nothing of the
  game travels in the APK; it is downloaded from the user's own Steam depot, on
  their own device, with their own account.
* **No Unity binaries.** `libunity.so`, `libmain.so` and `libil2cpp.so` are
  fetched or built on the device.
* **No mods, and no BepInEx.** The `BepInEx` and `0Harmony` assemblies a plugin
  references are this project's own shims (`tools/bepinex-shim`, MIT), not
  BepInEx's — the real ones assume a runtime loader that does not exist here.
  Plugins are files the user downloaded and put in the mods folder, and it is
  the user's own device that compiles them into their own build of the game.

## A note on the ETC2 encoder

`tools/bundle-surgery/Etc2.cs` is this project's own encoder and decoder for
ETC2 (RGB, RGB with punch-through alpha, and RGBA8 with EAC alpha), MIT like
the rest of the repository. It is written from the Khronos OpenGL ES 3.0
specification, appendix C, whose block layouts and modifier tables it
reproduces; no code from any other encoder is included. It is used only on
the PC, to re-encode a depot's DXT textures into same-size ETC2 patches; the
device applies those bytes and never runs the codec.

## A note on `classdata.tpk`

`assets/ondevice/bundle-surgery/classdata.tpk` is a type-package database that
AssetsTools.NET uses to deserialise Unity asset bundles whose type trees have
been stripped, as Silksong's are. It describes Unity's **serialisation layouts**
— class identifiers, field names and their types — and contains no Unity code,
no Unity assemblies and no game data. It is redistributed from the
AssetsTools.NET ecosystem under the MIT licence.

It is included because parsing a type-tree-stripped bundle is impossible
without it, and it is the same kind of artefact as a file-format description.
